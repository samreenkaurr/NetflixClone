INTRODUCTION :
The Netflix clone project is a web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, aiming to replicate the user interface and some features of the popular streaming service, Netflix.
Let’s break down the project into its key components and functionalities. This project is implemented using a combination of three fundamental web technologies:
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript.

EXPLANATION:
HTML Structure:
The HTML file defines the structure of the web page, including the header, main content sections, and footer. Notable elements include:

Header: Contains the Netflix logo, language dropdown, and a “Sign in” button.
Main Sections: Divided into a hero section, features section, frequently asked questions (FAQ) section, and a “Get Started” email section.
Footer: Comprising multiple rows with links and information, including a language dropdown and Netflix India details.

CSS STYLING:
The CSS file is responsible for styling the HTML elements, providing a visually appealing and responsive layout. Some key styling aspects include:
Global Styling: Resets default margin and padding, sets the background color, and defines the font family.
Navbar Styling: Ensures the navigation bar is positioned at the top, styled the logo, language dropdown, and “Sign in” button.
Hero Section Styling: Creates an overlay on the hero background image, styles the hero card with the title, subtitle, and email form.
Feature Section Styling: Styles individual feature cards with details and images, including the background videos and GIFs.
FAQ Section Styling: Styles FAQ accordions, making them visually appealing and ensuring smooth transitions.

Js INTERACTIVITY:
The JavaScript file adds interactivity to the project, particularly to the FAQ section. Key JavaScript functionalities include:
Accordions: Enables the toggle functionality for FAQ accordions. Clicking on a question expands or collapses the corresponding answer, and the icon changes between a plus and a times symbol accordingly.
Event Listeners: Attaches click event listeners to each FAQ title, triggering the accordion functionality.

Project Responsiveness:
The project incorporates media queries to ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes. 
Notable breakpoints include adjustments for larger screens, such as tablets and desktops, to enhance the user experience.
